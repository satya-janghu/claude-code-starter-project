# Architecture & Technical Decisions

*Document key decisions made during development to maintain context for AI agents and team members.*

## Decision Template

For each decision, include:
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Date**: When the decision was made
- **Context**: Why this decision was needed
- **Options**: Alternatives considered
- **Rationale**: Why this option was chosen
- **Impact**: What this affects
- **Status**: Active | Superseded | Deprecated

## Notes for AI Agents

- Review relevant decisions before making changes to affected areas
- When proposing changes that conflict with documented decisions, highlight the conflict
- Update decision status when superseding previous decisions
- Add new decisions when making significant architectural or technical choices
- Consider impact on existing decisions when evaluating options
