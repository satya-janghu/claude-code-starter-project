2. **Update Project Overview**: Edit `CLAUDE.md` with your project specifics
3. **Test MCP Servers**: Try "use context7" in a prompt to verify installation
4. **Explore Agents**: Use "Use code-searcher to find authentication logic"

### Daily Development Routine
```
Morning: /update-memory-bank ‚Üí Review CLAUDE-activeContext.md
Coding: Use specialized agents + MCP servers as needed
Evening: Update CLAUDE-decisions.md with any architectural choices
```

---

## Memory Bank System

The memory bank keeps Claude informed about your project across sessions. Four key files work together:

### CLAUDE.md - Central Command
**Purpose**: Main project overview and MCP usage instructions
**Best Practices**:
- Update the "Project Overview" section with your actual project details
- Keep MCP server usage examples relevant to your tech stack
- Add project-specific coding standards in the "Development Guidelines" section

**Example customization**:
```markdown
## Project Overview
**Project**: E-commerce Platform API
**Tech Stack**: Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis
**Architecture**: Microservices with Docker
**Current Phase**: MVP development - user authentication and product catalog
```

### CLAUDE-patterns.md - Code Conventions
**Purpose**: Document your team's coding patterns and conventions
**When to update**: 
- After establishing new coding standards
- When adopting new libraries or frameworks
- After code reviews reveal common patterns

**Template sections to customize**:
```markdown
## API Design Patterns
- RESTful endpoints: `/api/v1/resource`
- Error responses: `{ error: "message", code: "ERROR_CODE" }`
- Authentication: JWT tokens in Authorization header

## Database Patterns
- Table naming: snake_case (e.g., `user_profiles`)
- Foreign keys: `{table}_id` (e.g., `user_id`)
- Indexes: Always on foreign keys and search fields
```

### CLAUDE-decisions.md - Architecture Decisions
**Purpose**: Track important technical decisions and their rationale
**When to use**:
- Choosing between technology options
- Architectural changes
- Performance optimization decisions
- Security implementation choices

**Example entry**:
```markdown
## Decision: Use Redis for Session Storage
**Date**: 2024-01-15
**Context**: Need scalable session management for multi-server deployment
**Options**: 
1. Memory (not scalable)
2. Database (too slow)
3. Redis (fast, scalable)
**Decision**: Redis with 30-minute TTL
**Rationale**: Performance + horizontal scaling capability
**Impact**: Requires Redis infrastructure, but enables load balancing
```

### CLAUDE-activeContext.md - Session State
**Purpose**: Track current work and maintain continuity between Claude sessions
**Best Practices**:
- Update at start/end of each coding session
- Be specific about current blockers
- Note what you learned or discovered

**Template usage**:
```markdown
## Current Task
Implementing user authentication with JWT tokens

## Progress Made
- ‚úÖ Created User model with bcrypt password hashing
- ‚úÖ Implemented registration endpoint
- üîÑ Working on login endpoint validation
- ‚è≥ Need to implement JWT token generation

## Next Steps
1. Complete login endpoint with proper error handling
2. Create middleware for JWT verification
3. Add refresh token mechanism

## Current Blockers
- Deciding between storing JWT secrets in env vs database
- Need to research token expiration best practices
```
